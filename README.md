# LogisticClass

Initialize the weights and bias to zero.

Calculate the sigmoid function, which is used to predict the probability of the output class.

Calculate the cost function, which measures how well the model fits the training data.

Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights and bias.

Update the weights and bias using the gradient and a learning rate.
